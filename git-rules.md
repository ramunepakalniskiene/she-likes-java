Git - not so stupid content tracker

Commit:
- set of data which we need to store
- contains also some metadata (data about data: commit message, author of commit, timestamp and branch)
- commit has got parent (except root commit - the first one)
Commit amend - useful for fixing of the last commit (changes the commit message or add some files)
