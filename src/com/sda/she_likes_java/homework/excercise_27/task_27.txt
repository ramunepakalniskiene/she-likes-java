Create a MyDate class containing three fields:
- year - of type int
- month - of type int
- day - of type int
Implement the Comparable interface for your class.
Create a Main class, add four MyDate objects to the list and perform sorting.

 Comparable provides a single sorting sequence.
 In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
